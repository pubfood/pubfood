## Contributing

All contributions are welcome. However there are rules and guidelines;

- Code contributions must be through a feature branch of your fork
- Feature branch should be squashed to a single commit
- Run tests, linting and formatting before a pull request (`npm test`)
- Pull requests can not be merged without being reviewed
- Use "Issues" for bug reports, feature requests and discussions
- Do not refactor existing code without a discussion
- Do not add a new third party dependency without a discussion
- Use semantic versioning and git tags for versioning
